 # Branch Management Rules

  ## Branch Naming Conventions
  - main: Production-ready code
  - develop: Integration branch for features
  - foundation/*: Core setup and infrastructure branches
  - feature/*: New features (e.g., feature/user-auth)
  - bugfix/*: Bug fixes (e.g., bugfix/login-crash)
  - hotfix/*: Emergency production fixes
  - release/*: Release preparation

  ## Branch Workflow Rules
  1. All development MUST branch off from:
     - develop (for features)
     - main (for hotfixes)
     - foundation (for core infrastructure)

  2. Branch Creation:
     - Use descriptive names with type prefix
     - Include ticket/issue number if applicable
     - Use lowercase and hyphens for readability

  3. Commit Guidelines:
     - Write clear commit messages
     - Use conventional commits format:
       - feat: New features
       - fix: Bug fixes
       - docs: Documentation
       - style: Formatting
       - refactor: Code restructuring
       - test: Test addition/modification
       - chore: Maintenance

  4. Merge Requirements:
     - All tests must pass
     - Code review required
     - No merge conflicts
     - Up-to-date with base branch
     - Proper documentation updated

  5. Code Review Process:
     - At least one approval required
     - No unresolved comments
     - All CI checks passing
     - Test coverage maintained/improved

  6. Branch Cleanup:
     - Delete branches after successful merge
     - Regular cleanup of stale branches
     - Keep remote and local in sync

  7. Protected Branches:
     - main: Requires PR and review
     - develop: Requires PR and review
     - foundation/*: Requires PR and review

  8. Release Process:
     - Create release branch from develop
     - Version bump and changelog
     - Final testing and review
     - Merge to main with tag
     - Merge back to develop

  9. Emergency Fixes:
     - Hotfix branches from main
     - Immediate review priority
     - Merge to main AND develop

  10. Documentation:
      - Update docs with branch changes
      - Keep README current
      - Document breaking changes

  ## Branch Enforcement
  - CI/CD pipeline enforces these rules
  - Regular compliance audits
  - Team code review enforces standards
  - Automated branch protection rules
