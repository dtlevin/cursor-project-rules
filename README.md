# Cursor Project Development Rules

This document outlines the strict development workflow and rules that must be followed when working on this project using Cursor IDE.

## Core Principles

1. **Strict Adherence to Process**
   - Every interaction must begin with a review of these rules
   - All steps must be followed in exact order
   - No assumptions about requirements
   - No skipping of verification steps

2. **Documentation First**
   - All development must be aligned with the development plan
   - Documentation must be kept up-to-date
   - Tasks must be properly marked as completed

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - All steps must be verified before proceeding
   - Deviations must be documented and corrected
   - Clarification must be sought for any ambiguity

## Development Workflow

### 1. Documentation Review
Before starting any work, developers must:
- Review the development plan (`simpleList/Documentation/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`)
- Read the app description (`simpleList/Documentation/app_description.txt`)
- Verify the current development phase

### 2. Branch Management
Ensure proper branch workflow:
- Verify current branch
- Confirm branch type (feature/foundation/bugfix)
- Validate branch naming convention
- Check branch source (develop/main)

### 3. Implementation Planning
Before coding:
- Cross-reference with development plan
- Verify technical requirements
- Review code structure requirements
- Check naming conventions
- Validate against app description

### 4. Approval Process
Before making changes:
- Present complete implementation plan
- Wait for explicit approval
- Confirm all requirements are met
- Verify no steps were skipped

## Important Warnings

- ⚠️ Never proceed to the next step without completing the previous one
- ⚠️ Never assume approval
- ⚠️ Never make changes without following all steps
- ⚠️ Stop and ask for clarification if any step is unclear

## Documentation Updates

After completing any task:
1. Update `simpleList/Documentation/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
2. Mark completed tasks with [x]
3. Verify the development plan is current before proceeding

## Getting Help

If you encounter any ambiguity or uncertainty:
1. Stop immediately
2. Document the issue
3. Request clarification
4. Wait for explicit guidance before proceeding
